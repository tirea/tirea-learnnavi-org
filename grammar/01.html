<p><span class="navi">Kaltxì</span>! And welcome to Lesson 1 of Learn Na'vi Grammar the Easy Way.</p>

<p>Ok so to start, let's talk about how words fit together to make sentences.</p>

<h2 id="1">Word Order</h2>

<p><u>In English</u>, there is an order which words have to go in order for the sentence makes sense:</p>

<blockquote><span class="blue">people</span> eat <span class="red">vegetables</span>.</blockquote>

<p>It's clear here who is eating what because of the order. We always put <span class="blue">who is doing the eating</span> first, then <i>eat</i> and then <span class="red">what is being eaten</span>. Because of this word order telling us this information of who's eating who, we don't need to change the words themselves. we just put them in their place. If you mix up the words, the meaning completely changes:</p>

<blockquote><span class="red">vegetables</span> eat <span class="blue">people</span>.</blockquote>

<p>This has the opposite meaning as above.</p>

<p><u>In Na'vi</u>, there is more freedom. This means that the word order doesn't matter as much. Because of that, we need to change the words themselves ever so slightly sometimes in order to keep track of who is eating and what's being eaten. Therefore:</p>

<div id="endpostpreview"></div>
<blockquote><strong><span class="blue">aysutel</span> yom <span class="red">ayfkxenit</span></strong>.</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><strong><span class="red">ayfkxenit</span> yom <span class="blue">aysutel</span></strong>.</blockquote>

<p>are equal in meaning. This also means that</p>

<blockquote><strong><span class="blue">ayfkxenìl</span> yom <span class="red">aysuteti</span></strong>.</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><strong><span class="red">aysuteti</span> yom <span class="blue">ayfkxenìl</span></strong>.</blockquote>

<p>are equal in meaning but these two senteces mean the opposite of all the four sentences above them.</p>

<h2 id="2">Some Stuff</h2>

<p>So you may have noticed that the Na'vi words above are these:</p>

<ul class="nobullets">
<li><span class="navi">aysutel</span></li>
<li><span class="navi">aysuteti</span></li>
<li><span class="navi">yom</span></li>
<li><span class="navi">ayfkxenìl</span></li>
<li><span class="navi">ayfkxenit</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span class="blue">aysutel</span></strong> and <strong><span class="red">aysutet</span></strong> come from <span class="navi">aysute</span> (<i>people</i>) which is several <span class="navi">tute</span> (<i>person</i>).</p>

<p><span class="navi">yom</span> is <i>eat</i></p>

<p><strong><span class="blue">ayfkxenìl</span></strong> and <strong><span class="red">ayfkxenit</span></strong> come from <span class="navi">ayfkxen</span> (<i>vegetables</i>) which is several <span class="navi">fkxen</span> (<i>vegetable</i>)</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, these words have either <strong><span class="blue">l</span></strong>, <strong><span class="blue">ìl</span></strong>, <strong><span class="red">it</span></strong>, or <strong><span class="red">ti</span></strong> on the end. This is, as described above, how we keep track of who's eating what. We put stuff on the end.</p>

<p>notice:</p>

<ul class="nobullets">
<li>All the words that have these endings are always either a Person, Place, or thing.</li>
<li><span class="navi">yom</span> is a word listed as type <i>vtr.</i> in the LearnNavi.org dictionary. ONLY words listed as <i>vtr.</i> (or sometimes <i>vtrm.</i>) can be used with these endings.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span class="blue">l</span></strong> and <strong><span class="blue">ìl</span></strong> are the same. There are two of them so there is a choice to use which one flows the best. Only use <strong><span class="blue">ìl</span></strong> on words that end with consonants (like n, t, p, k, kx, ng for example.), and <strong><span class="blue">l</span></strong> on words that end with a vowel (like, a, ä, e, i, ì, o, u). These are put on the thing which is doing the action. Here, <span class="blue">the thing that is doing the eating</span>.</p>

<p><strong><span class="red">ti</span></strong> and <strong><span class="red">it</span></strong> are the same. Use <strong><span class="red">it</span></strong> on words that end with consonants, and <strong><span class="red">ti</span></strong> on words that end with a vowel. These are put on the one that is receiving the action. Here, <span class="red">the thing that is being eaten</span>.</p>

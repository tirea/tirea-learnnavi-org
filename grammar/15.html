<p><span class="navi">Kaltxì.</span> <img class="smiley" src="/res/smiley.gif"> Let's talk about Na'vi numbers.</p>

<p> So if you are a fan of AVATAR, you would have noticed that the Na'vi have four-finger hands. (Three fingers and a thumb..)<br>
<br>
<img src="../posts/res/phpifiRLmPM.jpg"></p>

<p>Because of this, the Na'vi, when counting on hands, only get to eight, and then have to start again. That's the basic idea, or reason behind why groups of eight, and not ten, like most humans (who have five-finger hands).</p>

<h2 id="1">How to count in Na'vi:</h2>

<div class="endpostpreview"></div>

<blockquote class="navi">
'aw, <u>mu</u>ne, pxey, tsìng, mrr, <u>pu</u>kap, <u>ki</u>nä, vol.<br> 
<br> 
vo<u>law</u>, vo<u>mun</u>, vo<u>pey</u>, vo<u>sìng</u>, vo<u>mrr</u>, vo<u>fu</u>, vo<u>hin</u>, <u>me</u>vol.</blockquote>


<p>In digits:</p>

<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;">°1, °2, °3, °4, °5, °6, °7, °10.<br> <br> °11, °12, °13, °14, °15, °16, °17, °20.</blockquote>

<p>Note: Using a degree sign means you are using the Na’vi number system which is based on eights. Using no degree sign means you are using the skypeople number system which is based on tens.<br> <br> In English:</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.<br> <br> eight and one, eight and two, eight and three, eight and four, eight and five, eight and six, eight and seven, two eights.</blockquote>

<p>That is basically how to count all the fingers on both hands then all the toes on both feet of a Na'vi. To continue, it just follows the pattern.</p>

<p>It's a whole lot easier to convert Na'vi numbers into English than it is to convert English numbers into Na'vi.<br> <br> To translate a Na'vi number, such as <span class="navi">mevomrr</span>, it can be translated literally then multiplied and added up. <span class="navi">Mevomrr</span> is <em>two eights and five</em>. 2 × 8 + 5 → 16 + 5 = 21. So <span class="navi">mevomrr</span>, <em>two eights and five</em> is Twenty-one (two tens and one).<br> <br> Personally, I think it's still just as useful to know how many groups of eight something is, such as <em>two eights and five</em>. I can imagine that just as well as imagining two tens and one. So translating it further to groups of ten is just a tedious extra step in my opinion. But not everyone can think in groups of eights because they are <em>so</em> used to groups of ten. So doing this may be helpful for some people, even if time-consuming. I think it's just so much easier to learn to think in groups of eight, like the Na'vi. <img class="smiley" src="/res/smiley.gif"><br> <br> To translate an English number, such as twenty-one into Na'vi, it has to be converted into groups of eight and such first, then translated pretty much literally. Twenty-one is two tens and one. if you divide it into groups of eight, you get 21 ÷ 8 = 2 remainder 5. So twenty-one is <em>two eights and five</em>. Translating that to Na’vi is <span class="navi">mevomrr</span>.<br> <br> You probobly won't need to use numbers higher than <strong>zam</strong> (<em>sixty-four</em>), or even <strong>mevol</strong> (<em>two eights</em>), but if you do, you can play around with the <a href="http://www.learnnavi.org/navi-numbers">number tool on the main Learn Na'vi website</a>. It shows you how the numbers are made, with a little maths and colours. <img class="cheesy" src="/res/cheesy.gif"><br> <br> So now we know how to count and about the pattern of the numbers. How do we use the numbers? Like this:</p>


<blockquote><span class="navi">Tse'a oel nantangit apxevosìng.</span><br> 
<em>I see three-eights-and-four viperwolves.</em><br> 
<br> 
<span class="navi">Tutel atsìng yamom mevosìnga teylut.</span><br> 
<em>Four people ate two-eights-and-four teylu.</em></blockquote>

<p>The above can be written with digits like this:</p>

<blockquote><span class="navi">Tse'a oel nantangit a34°.</span><br> 
<em>I see three-eights-and-four viperwolves.</em><br> 
<br> 
<span class="navi">Tutel a4 yamom °24a teylut.</span><br> 
<em>Four people ate two-eights-and-four teylu.</em></blockquote>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Numbers are used like adjectives.</li>
<li>When you use a number, <strong>me+</strong>, <strong>pxe+</strong>, <strong>ay+</strong> prefixes are not used; the singular is used instead.</li>
<li>The digit degree sign is usually put on the opposite side of the a</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's pretty much it with numbers.<br> <br> Hopefully, this has been helpful in understanding and using Na'vi numbers. <img class="cheesy" src="/res/cheesy.gif"> Hayalovay.</p>

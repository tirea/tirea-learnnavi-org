Lesson Twelve: -ing in Na'vi
<p><span class="navi">Kaltxì</span> nìmun! This time I wanna talk about the three different ways to say -ing in Na'vi. {{:)}}</p>

<p>In English, we use the same -ing ending in at least three different ways. In Na'vi, all three of those translate to three different ways instead of using the same one.</p>

<p><u>In English</u>, the three main uses for -ing are as in the following examples:</p>

<p><blockquote><ol>
    <li><em>She <span class="red">is</span> hunt<span class="red">ing</span> a hexapede</em>.</li>
    <li><em>A hunt<span class="lime">ing</span> thanator is dangerous.</em></li>
    <li><em>Hunt<span class="gdocblue">ing</span> is fun.</em></li>
</ol></blockquote></p>

<p><u>In Na'vi</u>, these same three are:</p>

<p><blockquote><ol>
    <li><strong>Pol t<span class="red">er</span>aron yerikit.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>T<span class="lime">us</span>aron<span class="yellow">a</span> palulukan lu lehrrap.</strong></li>
    <li><strong><span class="gdocblue">Tì</span>t<span class="lime">us</span>aron lu 'o'.</strong></li>
</ol></blockquote></p>

<p>In 1, we use the position 1 infix <span class="red">er</span> to show that "hunt" is an ongoing action, "hunting". Note that <span class="red">er</span> already has the meaning of "<span class="red">am/is/are</span> do<span class="red">ing</span>" built right in. So it's redundant and incorrect to say stuff like *Po lu teraron.<br>
<br>
In 2, the infix <span class="lime">us</span> is used. <span class="lime">us</span> is another position 1 infix, but instead of making a verb ongoing, it turns it into an adjective! T<span class="lime">us</span>aron<span class="yellow">a</span> palulukan, "a hunt<span class="lime">ing</span> thanator" -- "hunt<span class="lime">ing</span>" is an <em>adjective</em> describing the thanator, rather than saying "the thanator <span class="red">is</span> hunt<span class="red">ing</span>", which would use <span class="red">er</span>. Note that because the verb has been turned into an adjective, you must use -<span class="yellow">a</span>- with it. Also, <span class="lime">us</span> adjectives cannot be used with lu, as in *Po lu tusaron. You must say that as Po t<span class="red">er</span>aron, "he <span class="red">is</span> hunt<span class="red">ing</span>."<br>
<br>
In 3, we have taken the <span class="lime">us</span> form, and added the <span class="gdocblue">tì</span>- prefix to make it into a noun. You can add <span class="gdocblue">tì</span>- and <span class="lime">us</span> to any verb to make it mean "(<span class="gdocblue">the activity</span> of) verb-ing". <span class="gdocblue">Tì</span>t<span class="lime">us</span>aron lu 'o'. (<span class="gdocblue">the activity</span> of) hunting is fun.</p>

Hope this clears things up.

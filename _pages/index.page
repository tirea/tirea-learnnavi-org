<p>The point of this website is to help and teach anyone and everyone who is 
willing to learn the Na'vi language. If you are discouraged and intimidated by 
advanced linguist terms, this is the place for you. I try to be as simple as 
possible here in all my explanations of the grammar.</p>

<p>Hop on over to the <a href="grammar">Grammar</a> section to get started.</p>
<p>And what not. And stuff.<br><br></p>

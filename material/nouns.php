      <p>Nouns are persons, places, things. 
        Na?vi nouns have no grammatical gender 
        and no ?the? or ?a?. This way, you can learn 
        the word and use it. Sometimes it changes. 
        (more about that later.) To learn more about
        how nouns work, check out the selections
        below.</p>

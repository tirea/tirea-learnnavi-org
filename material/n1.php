      <div class="titlename">Pronouns (pn.)</div>

      <p>Pronouns are words like I, you, he, she, it, 
        they, etc. Na'vi Pronouns are specific but 
        simple and logical. Take a look at the table below:</p>

      <table class="striped bordered">
        <thead>
        	<tr>
        		<th data-field="blank"></th>
        		<th data-field="singular">Singular (1)</th>
        		<th data-field="dual">Dual (2)</th>
        		<th data-field="trial">Trial (3)</th>
        		<th data-field="plural">Plural (many)</th>
        	</tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        	<tr>
        		<th>1st Exclusive (I/We, not you)</th>
        		<td>oe</td>
        		<td>moe</td>
        		<td>pxoe</td>
        		<td>ayoe</td>
        	</tr>
        	<tr>
        		<th>1st Inclusive (I/We, and you)</th>
        		<td>----</td>
        		<td>oeng</td>
        		<td>pxoeng</td>
        		<td>ayoeng / awnga</td>
       		</tr>
       		<tr>
       			<th>2nd (you, you guys)</th>
       			<td>nga</td>
       			<td>menga</td>
       			<td>pxenga</td>
       			<td>aynga</td>
       		</tr>
       		<tr>
       			<th>3rd Animate (he/she/they)</th>
       			<td>po</td>
       			<td>mefo</td>
       			<td>pxefo</td>
       			<td>ayfo / fo</td>
       		</tr>
       		<tr>
       			<th>3rd Inanimate (that/"it"/they)</th>
       			<td>tsa'u / tsaw</td>
       			<td>mesa'u</td>
       			<td>pxesa'u</td>
       			<td>aysa'u / sa'u</td>
       		</tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>There are also poe (she) and poan (he) for 3rd animate singular, but po
        (gender-neutral) is more commonly used. There's also sno, which means 
        self.</P>
